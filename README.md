# MyG

### About
MyG is about working with Google APIs directly from a Google Extension.
I'm not an expert (trust me I'm an engineer), I mainly work with SharePoint, discovering non MS technologies is very challenging.
I can promise that there will be a ton of mistakes, hiccups and even non-sense. Feel free to show the (right) way.

### Enabling Google APIs
1. Open the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. Create a new Project
3. Create a new set of Credentials :
    1. Create a new API Key
    2. Create a new OAuth 2.0 client IDs (I used Chrome App, it seems to be enough)
4. From the dashboard, enable the Google API for Drive and Gmail.

### Folder Structure
MyG extension is divided into several sub-folders :
- css/ ...  for stylesheet
- img/ ...  for icons & logos 
- pages/ ... for pages (HTML + JS)
- scripts/ ... for javascript resources (jquery, bootstrap, tablesorter, my own generic code)

### Inspired by
I look after this article https://www.sitepoint.com/mastering-your-inbox-with-gmail-javascript-api/ 
I had to made some changes to make sure it was working with the Google Chrome Extension.



Stay tuned.

Et gros bisous,
